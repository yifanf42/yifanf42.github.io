Digital alloy In0.52Al0.48 As avalanche photodiodes exhibit lower excess noise than those fabricated from random alloys. This paper compares the temperature dependence, from 203K to 323K, of the impact ionization characteristics of In0.52Al0.48As and Al0.74Ga0.26As digital and random alloys. These results provide insight into the low excess noise exhibited by some digital alloy materials, and these materials can even obtain lower excess noise at low temperature.
