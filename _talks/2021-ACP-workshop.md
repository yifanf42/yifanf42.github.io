Workshop: Heterogeneous Photonic Integration on Silicon

Silicon has become the platform of choice for large-scale photonic integration. Its compatibility with the mature CMOS processing technology offers the well-known advantages of scalability, low-cost at high-volume, and high yield. Despite its success during the last 20 years in both academia and industry, further improvement on functionalities and performances of silicon photonic circuits beyond the limitations posed by the intrinsic material capabilities of silicon is needed for photonics. Improvements in silicon photonics for efficient light generation, optical amplification, high-speed and efficient optical modulation, low-noise high quantum-efficiency high-speed photodetectors, nonlinear photonic devices and integrated quantum photonic applications may be brought about with the use of different materials integrated on silicon. Heterogeneous integration technology can bring together silicon and other materials with better optical properties. Combining the best of different material systems, it holds the potential to realize full functioning photonic circuits. This workshop will focus on recent advances and future developments of heterogeneous photonic integration on silicon in all related aspects including fabrication processes, discrete devices, integration technologies, novel two-dimensional materials on silicon etc.
