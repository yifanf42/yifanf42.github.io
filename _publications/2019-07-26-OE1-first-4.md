title: "Triple-mesa avalanche photodiodes with very low surface dark current"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-07-26-OE1-first-4
excerpt: 'The dark current of a photodetector is a key parameter for high-sensitivity optical receivers. We report low-dark-current, triple-mesa avalanche photodiodes that have ~50 times lower dark current than conventional single-mesa devices, and suppress surface leakage. The tolerances of triple-mesa avalanche photodiode parameters are presented.'

The dark current of a photodetector is a key parameter for high-sensitivity optical receivers. We report low-dark-current, triple-mesa avalanche photodiodes that have ~50 times lower dark current than conventional single-mesa devices, and suppress surface leakage. The tolerances of triple-mesa avalanche photodiode parameters are presented.
