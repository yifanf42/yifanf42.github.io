excerpt: 'Integrated optical filter and photodetectors and methods of fabrication thereof are described herein according to the present disclosure. An example of an integrated optical filter and photodetector described herein includes a substrate, an insulator layer on the substrate, and a semiconductor layer on the insulator layer. An optical filter having a resonant cavity is formed in or on the semiconductor layer. The integrated optical filter and photodetector further includes two first metal fingers and a second metal finger interdigitated between the two first metal fingers on the semiconductor layer forming Schottky barriers. The first metal fingers are constructed from a different metal relative to the second metal finger.'
