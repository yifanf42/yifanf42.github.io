collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-APL115-number-6
excerpt: '3D band structure-based Monte Carlo simulations have been utilized to simulate InAlAs digital alloy avalanche photodiodes. The simulated current–voltage curve and excess noise factor fit well with experimental results. Ionization coefficients calculated by the Monte Carlo technique were incorporated into the recurrence model, which is easier to implement and requires less computation time.'
