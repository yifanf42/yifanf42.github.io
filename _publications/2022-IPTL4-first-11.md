excerpt: 'We investigate the bit error rates and eye diagrams of Si-Ge avalanche photodiodes at 32 Gb/s NRZ for different optical signal-to-noise ratios. The relationship between receiver sensitivity and optical signals quality has been analyzed using theoretical calculation and simulation. This sensitivity analysis provides guidance on signal quality tolerances for the APD-based optical links.'

We investigate the bit error rates and eye diagrams of Si-Ge avalanche photodiodes at 32 Gb/s NRZ for different optical signal-to-noise ratios. The relationship between receiver sensitivity and optical signals quality has been analyzed using theoretical calculation and simulation. This sensitivity analysis provides guidance on signal quality tolerances for the APD-based optical links.
