We report AlxIn1-xAsySb1-y PIN and Separate Absorption, Charge and Multiplication (SACM) avalanche photodiodes (APDs) with high temperature stability. This work is based on measurements of avalanche breakdown voltage of these devices for temperatures between 223 K and 363 K. Breakdown voltage temperature coefficients are shown to be lower than those of APDs fabricated with other materials with comparable multiplication layer thicknesses.
