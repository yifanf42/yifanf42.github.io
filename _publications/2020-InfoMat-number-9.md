excerpt: 'Avalanche photodiodes fabricated from AlInAsSb grown as a digital alloy exhibit low excess noise. In this article, we investigate the band structure-related mechanisms that influence impact ionization. Band-structures calculated using an empirical tight-binding method and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the mini-gaps in the conduction band do not inhibit electron impact ionization. Good agreement between the full band Monte Carlo simulations and measured noise characteristics is demonstrated.'

Abstract:
Avalanche photodiodes fabricated from AlInAsSb grown as a digital alloy exhibit low excess noise. In this article, we investigate the band structure-related mechanisms that influence impact ionization. Band-structures calculated using an empirical tight-binding method and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the mini-gaps in the conduction band do not inhibit electron impact ionization. Good agreement between the full band Monte Carlo simulations and measured noise characteristics is demonstrated.
