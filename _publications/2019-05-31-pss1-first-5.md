excerpt: 'The optical absorption characteristics of the InAlAs digital alloy semiconductor are investigated. The external quantum efficiency of the InAlAs digital alloy is compared with that of the In0.52Al0.48As random alloy. Unlike the random alloy, the digital alloy exhibits electric?field?induced Stark localization, which increases the optical absorption and suppresses the Franz-Keldysh red shift of the optical absorption edge.'

The optical absorption characteristics of the InAlAs digital alloy semiconductor are investigated. The external quantum efficiency of the InAlAs digital alloy is compared with that of the In0.52Al0.48As random alloy. Unlike the random alloy, the digital alloy exhibits electric?field?induced Stark localization, which increases the optical absorption and suppresses the Franz-Keldysh red shift of the optical absorption edge.
