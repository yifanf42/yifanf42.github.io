Abstract:
We report Al0.8In0.2As0.23Sb0.77 avalanche photodiodes with high gain (M>1300) and low dark current at room temperature. Impact ionization coefficients for this material system are also extracted, indicating electron-dominant impact ionization. Low avalanche breakdown temperature dependence is demonstrated.
