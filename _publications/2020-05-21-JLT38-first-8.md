excerpt: 'A Si-Ge waveguide avalanche photodiode with extremely high temperature stability is demonstrated. The breakdown voltage increases ~4.2 mV/°C, bandwidth reduces ~0.09%/°C, and gain-bandwidth product reduces ~0.24%/°C with temperature increased from 30 °C to 90 °C. Additionally, it maintains superior performance with low breakdown voltage of ~10 V, high multiplication gain of >15, high bandwidth of ~24.6 GHz, high gain-bandwidth product of >240 GHz, high internal quantum efficiency of ~100%, and clear eye diagrams with 64 Gbps PAM4 modulation at 90 °C.'
