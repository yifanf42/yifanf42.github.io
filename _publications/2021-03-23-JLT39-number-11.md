collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-03-23-JLT39-number-11
excerpt: 'III-V material based digital alloy Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) have recently been found to exhibit low noise similar to Silicon APDs. The III-V materials can be chosen to operate at any wavelength in the infrared spectrum. In this work, we present a physics-based SPICE compatible compact model for APDs built from parameters extracted from an Environment-Dependent Tight Binding (EDTB) model calibrated to ab-initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Using this approach, we can accurately capture the physical characteristics of these APDs in integrated photonics circuit simulations.'
