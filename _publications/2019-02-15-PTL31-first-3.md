excerpt: 'Digital alloy AlInAsSb avalanche photodiodes exhibit low excess noise comparable to those fabricated from Si. The electron and hole ionization coefficients are critical parameters for simulation and analysis of high-sensitivity receivers. We report ionization coefficients using a mixed injection technique that employs measurement of the gain for different incident wavelengths and a simulation algorithm.'

Digital alloy AlInAsSb avalanche photodiodes exhibit low excess noise comparable to those fabricated from Si. The electron and hole ionization coefficients are critical parameters for simulation and analysis of high-sensitivity receivers. We report ionization coefficients using a mixed injection technique that employs measurement of the gain for different incident wavelengths and a simulation algorithm.
