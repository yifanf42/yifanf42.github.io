excerpt: 'Examples described herein relate to an avalanche photodiode (APD) and an optical receiver including the APD. The APD may include a substrate and a photon absorption region disposed on the substrate. The substrate may include a charge carrier acceleration region under the photon absorption region; a charge region adjacent to the charge carrier acceleration region; and a charge carrier multiplication region adjacent to the charge region. The charge carrier acceleration region, the charge region, and the charge carrier multiplication region are laterally formed in the substrate. When a biasing voltage is applied to the optoelectronic device, photon-generated free charge carriers may be generated in the photon absorption region and are diffused into the charge carrier acceleration region. The charge carrier acceleration region is configured to accelerate the photon-generated free charge carriers prior to the photon-generated free charge carriers entering into the charge region and undergoing impact ionization in the charge carrier multiplication region.'

Examples described herein relate to an avalanche photodiode (APD) and an optical receiver including the APD. The APD may include a substrate and a photon absorption region disposed on the substrate. The substrate may include a charge carrier acceleration region under the photon absorption region; a charge region adjacent to the charge carrier acceleration region; and a charge carrier multiplication region adjacent to the charge region. The charge carrier acceleration region, the charge region, and the charge carrier multiplication region are laterally formed in the substrate. When a biasing voltage is applied to the optoelectronic device, photon-generated free charge carriers may be generated in the photon absorption region and are diffused into the charge carrier acceleration region. The charge carrier acceleration region is configured to accelerate the photon-generated free charge carriers prior to the photon-generated free charge carriers entering into the charge region and undergoing impact ionization in the charge carrier multiplication region.
