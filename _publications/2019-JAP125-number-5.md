Abstract:
InAlAs digital alloy avalanche photodiodes (APDs) exhibit lower noise than their random alloy counterparts. The electronic dispersion properties of digital alloy materials are unique, creating minigaps in their valence band structure. In this paper, we use computational models with environment-dependent tight-binding parameters to calculate the electronic dispersion properties of InAlAs digital alloys with various stacking directions, stacking modes, and periods, which can provide guidance for optimizing the structure of InAlAs digital alloy APDs.
