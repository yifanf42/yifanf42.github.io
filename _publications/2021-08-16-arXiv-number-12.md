excerpt: 'Simple analytical expressions for estimation of second order output intercept point (OIP2) and third order output intercept point (OIP3) of surface normal uni-traveling carrier (UTC) and modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) photodiode (PD) are derived. These equations are valuable for estimation of OIP for high power (M)UTC-PDs during the design phase.'

Simple analytical expressions for estimation of second order output intercept point (OIP2) and third order output intercept point (OIP3) of surface normal uni-traveling carrier (UTC) and modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) photodiode (PD) are derived. These equations are valuable for estimation of OIP for high power (M)UTC-PDs during the design phase.
