permalink: /publication/6/8/2021-IJoSTiQE1-first-9
excerpt: 'We present a loop reflector-assisted silicon-germanium waveguide avalanche photodiode with improved responsivity. Compared to the same APD without the reflector, it has 1.49 times higher responsivity,  ~1.12 A/W, without compromising the speed performance. It exhibits a 3 dB-bandwidth of  ~25 GHz, a build-up time limited gain-bandwidth product of ~296 GHz, a highest gain-bandwidth product of  ~497 GHz. Clear eye diagrams are measured at both 32 Gbps NRZ and 64 Gbps PAM4 modulation, and a 1~2 dB better sensitivity up to -15.7 dBm with 32 Gbps NRZ at a BER of 2.4e-4.'

We present a loop reflector-assisted silicon-germanium waveguide avalanche photodiode with improved responsivity. Compared to the same APD without the reflector, it has 1.49 times higher responsivity,  ~1.12 A/W, without compromising the speed performance. It exhibits a 3 dB-bandwidth of  ~25 GHz, a build-up time limited gain-bandwidth product of ~296 GHz, a highest gain-bandwidth product of  ~497 GHz. Clear eye diagrams are measured at both 32 Gbps NRZ and 64 Gbps PAM4 modulation, and a 1~2 dB better sensitivity up to -15.7 dBm with 32 Gbps NRZ at a BER of 2.4e-4.
