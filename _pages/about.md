I am currently a graduate student in the Electronic Science and Technology  and a rsearch assistant at Shanghaitech University. My main research interest includes optoelectronic device, integrated photonics and their applications in sening and computing. I will receive M.S. degree in <a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/chenbl/#about" targe="-blank"> Prof. Baile Chen's group </a>. Previously, I obtained B.S in Physics from Shanghaitech University.

I am seeking Phd posistion in 2026 fall. You can also find my <a href="cv.pdf" target="-blank"> CV here </a>.
